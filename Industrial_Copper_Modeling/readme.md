> ## **Overview**

   This project aims to create a machine learning model for predicting the price of the copper and status of the leads 

   
# Approach 

  - Load Copper_Set.xlsx - Result 1.csv file into pandas DataFrame.
    
  - Clean and preprocess the data to remove outliers, skewness, less important features

  - Convert catagorical into numerical data using one hot encoding

  - Train different regression models and compare the 'MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR, MEAN SQUARED ERROR AND R2 SCORE' values to select the best

    model for price prediction

  - Use grid search to find the best hyperparameters for selected model

  - train the model using best hyperparameters and pickle the model
    
  - Implement Streamlit to present code and data in a user-friendly UI.
    
  - Use plotly and seaborn for data visualisation.
   

# Getting Started

  - Install/Import the necessary modules: Streamlit, Pandas, folium, plotly,seaborn and geopandas.
    

# Technical Steps to Execute the Project

### Step 1: Install/Import Modules

   - Ensure the required Python modules are installed: Streamlit, Pandas, folium, plotly,seaborn and geopandas.

### Step 2: Write required codes to load and clean the data

   - In this step cover tasks like data cleaning and data analysis

### Step 3: Run the Project with Streamlit

   - Execute the command: streamlit run main.py. This will open a web browser, such as Google Chrome, displays the user interface.

# **singapore flat resale price prediction**


> ## **Overview**

   This project aims to create a machine learning model for predicting the resale price of flats in singapore 

   
# Approach 

  - Load singapore flat resale price data file into pandas DataFrame.
    
  - Clean and preprocess the data to less important features

  - Use plotly and seaborn for data visualisation

  - Convert catagorical into numerical data using one hot encoding

  - Train different regression models and compare the `MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR, MEAN SQUARE ERROR AND R2 SCORE` values to select the best model for price prediction

  - Train the model using best hyperparameters and pickle the model

# Getting Started

  - Install/Import the necessary modules: Streamlit, Pandas, sk learn, plotly and seaborn.
    

# Technical Steps to Execute the Project

### Step 1: Install/Import Modules

   - Ensure the required Python modules are installed: Streamlit, Pandas, sk learn, plotly and seaborn.

### Step 2: Write required codes to load and clean the data

   - In this step cover tasks like data cleaning and data analysis

### Step 3: Run the Project with Streamlit

   - Execute the command: streamlit run main.py. This will open a web browser, such as Google Chrome, displays the user interface.

![euqVCkZS](https://github.com/AK1612/DS-_projects/assets/159476917/d4d7da3f-58a6-41ed-aaf9-d320e5fa90b2)


# Overview

 - This project is focused on cloning the data from Phonepe pulse Github repository, processing the data, warehousing the data and to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner. The harvested data is stored in a SQL database for in-depth data analysis. The project's core functionality relies on the Extract, Transform, Load, process & visualize.

# Approach 

  - clone the data from Phonepe pulse github repository.
    
  - Store channel data in SQL records for data analysis
    
  - Implement Streamlit to present code and data in a user-friendly UI.
    
  - Execute data analysis using SQL queries and Python integration.

# Getting Started

  - Install/Import the necessary modules: Streamlit, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, MySql & Plotly.
    
  - Ensure you have access to MYSQL and set up a SQL DBMS on your local environment.

# Technical Steps to Execute the Project

### Step 1: Install/Import Modules

   - Ensure the required Python modules are installed: SQLAlchemy, MYSQL, Streamlit, Pandas and Plotly.

### Step 2: Write required codes to extract, clean and store the data

   - In this step cover tasks like data retrieval, data storage, and data analysis

### Step 3: Run the Project with Streamlit

   - Open the command prompt in the directory where "app.py" is located.
   - Execute the command: streamlit run app.py. This will open a web browser, such as Google Chrome, displaying the project's user interface.

### Step 4: Configure Databases

   - Ensure that you are connected to MYSQL DBMS.

# Methods

   - Get Phonepe pulse Data: Clone Phonepe pulse data repository.
     
   - Store required data: Store required data into sql data base using SqlAlchemy.
     
   - Data Analysis: Conducts data analysis using SQL queries and Python integration.
     
   - Data visualisation: Visualize the data in map, cahrts using plotly
